 # PySpark Series - 30 Days of PySpark

Welcome to **pyspark_series**! This repository is designed for anyone who wants to get hands-on with PySpark and enhance their skills with a 30-day series covering various PySpark concepts and applications.

## 📖 About the Series

In this **30-day PySpark Series**, each day focuses on a specific PySpark topic or concept, ranging from the basics to more advanced data processing techniques. The aim is to provide concise, practical code examples to help you develop and deepen your understanding of PySpark and big data processing.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository contains a directory for each day with a descriptive title that represents the topic covered. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- `README.md` - Explanation of the day's topic
- Jupyter Notebook or Python file with the example code and exercises
- Sample datasets (if applicable)

## 🗓️ Topics Covered

Some of the topics that this series will cover include:

1. Day 1: Introduction to PySpark
2. Day 2: Setting Up SparkSession
3. Day 3: Working with DataFrames
4. Day 4: Data Loading and Exploration
5. Day 5: Column Manipulations
6. Day 6: Filtering and Selecting Data
7. Day 7: Aggregations and GroupBy
8. Day 8: Joins in PySpark
